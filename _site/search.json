    "text": "Brier Gallihugh, M.S.\n\n\nPersonal Summary\nI am a third year experimental psychology doctoral candidate at Ohio University. I bring over 5 years of detail oriented experience using various quantitative research methodologies (e.g., experimental design and survey development) and conducting various statistical analyses (e.g., ANOVA, regression, moderation and mediation, meta-analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, etc.) to understand human behavior. Further I also have some experience with semi-structured interviewing. I am proficient in the use of both SPSS and R for data analysis and ggplot2 for data visualization.\nRelevant Soft Skills\n• Communication\n• Collaboration\n• Project Management\n• Oral Presentation\n\n\nExperience\n\n\n\nPrinciple Psychology Researcher\nAugust 2020-Present\n\n\n\nOhio University\nConformity, Attitudes, Threat and Stereotypes (CATS) Lab\n• Designed, developed and administered studies pertaining to insights regarding psychological topics of human behavior including prejudice, discrimination, and attitudes as they related to racial, ethnic and religious minorities in addition to political affiliation\n• Cleaned and analyzed data using statistical procedures including ANOVA, t-tests, regression, multiple regression, moderation, mediation, and sentiment analysis using R statistical software with the RStudio IDE\n• Incorporated version control for statistical analyses using Git and GitHub to ensure data reproducibility\n• Research resulted in 13 research studies across 6 projects resulting in a conference poster, departmental talk, and a manuscript currently in progress\n• Collaborated with other researchers to analyze data and parse out insights regarding human morality\n\n\n\nInstructor of Record\nJanuary 2022-Present\n\n\n\nOhio University\nPSY 2510: Social Psychology\n• Designed slide decks and presented course content via lecture format related to social cognition, the self, prejudice and discrimination, research design, etc. to 90 students across 2 semesters\n• Assessed students on their course knowledge by designing 4 tests, 10 quizzes, and requiring a written final paper to demonstrate critical thinking and reflection\n• Student evaluations indicated a high degree overall quality for both the instructor [4.58/5.0] and the course [4.31/5.0].\n\n\n\nPrinciple Psychology Researcher\nAugust 2017-August 2021\n\n\n\nEastern Michigan University\n• Designed, developed and administered studies pertaining to insights regarding psychological topics involving prejudice and attitudes as they related to racial and religious minorities in addition to voting behavior involving sexual misconduct allegations\n• Cleaned and analyzed data using statistical procedures including ANOVA, t-tests, correlation, mediation, exploratory factor analysis using R statistical software with the RStudio IDE\n• Research resulted in 5 studies across 4 projects resulting in a 3 conference posters, a master’s thesis proposal, and thesis defense\n\n\nSelected Projects\nBlack Lives Matter\n• This research looked to investigate the role that multicultural attitudes (i.e., celebration of differences) and colorblind attitudes (i.e., avoiding differences) play in predicting support for Black Lives Matter (and All Lives Matter) using a series of multiple regressions and experimental manipulations. The results largely indicate that support for Black Lives Matter is positive associated with endorsement of multicultural attitudes and negatively associated with endorsement of colorblind attitudes. By comparison, All Lives Matter support is positively associated with endorsement of colorblind attitudes and negatively associated with endorsement of multicultural attitudes. This work suggests that organizations who wish to increase support for Black Lives Matter would be wise to focus on interventions which increase one’s positive attitudes toward a multicultural society.\n• This research has resulted in one departmental talk and one research manuscript\nThe Marley Hypothesis: A Gender Extension\n• This research looked to investigate the role of historical literacy (with respect to women’s rights) on the relationship between gender and willingness to identify a situation as sexist using a series of mediation analyses. The results largely indicate that historical literacy does not impact the relationship between gender and willingness to identify a situation as sexist.\n• This research has resulted in a proposed conference poster presentation. The poster can be found here\nChristian Privilege Awareness\n• This research looked to create a scale measure to assess the level of Christian privilege awareness among self-professed Christians through the use of scale development principles (i.e., theory development) and statistical analysis (e.g., exploratory factor analysis).

    "text": "For today’s #TidyTuesday (January 25, 2023)1, we are looking at the survival TV series Alone which has run since 2015 across 10 seasons. The premise of the show is to put individuals into sparsely populated areas as they try to survive. For today’s visualization we will be looking at the loadouts data set in the alone package2. This data set contains information on the participant, the season in which the participant appeared on the show, and the discarded items.\nFor this visualization, creating a word cloud would be a very interesting way to visualize which items are most commonly discarded. To attempt this visualization we will need the tidyverse,ggtext, and ggwordcloud packages. To start we want to download the data. You can find the file here. The code below shows loading in the appropriate packages and reading in the data\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggwordcloud)\n\ndata <- read.csv(\"loadouts.csv\")\n\nAfter we have downloaded the data, we will need to modify the data a little bit to get some of the information that we will need in the format that we need it in. For the word cloud we need to aggregate the items and count the number of times said item was discarded. To do this we will need to sum the number of items by group. That code can be shown below\n\ndata <- data %>% \n  mutate(item = as.factor(item)) %>%\n  group_by(item) %>% summarize(n_item = sum(item_number),.groups = \"drop\") %>% \n  mutate(color = rep(c(\"darkgreen\",\"darkred\",\"darkblue\"),9)) \n\n\nI have added a color variable to add color to the word cloud labels later\n\nOnce initial data wrangling has been done, it is time to actually start the visualization. To do this we are going to feed our data into a ggplot2 pipeline. We will be assigning the item variable to the label argument and the n_item variable to the size argument. This will tell ggplot to label the word cloud with the appropriate labeling convention while mapping the size of the word to the number of times it is discarded in total across the 10 seasons.\nFor aesthetic purposes, I’ve decided to make the word cloud figure diamond shaped but there are multiple shapes one could use (e.g., a circle).\n\np <- data %>% ggplot(aes(label = item, size = n_item, color = color)) + \n  geom_text_wordcloud_area(show_boxes = FALSE,\n                           shape = \"diamond\") + \n  scale_size_area(max_size = 12)\n\nBelow we see what the code above generates. This looks reasonably good but we can do some more with this graphic such as adding a title, doing some theme changes, adding a caption, and ensuring there is some alt text describing the graphic embedded in the webpage that should be available if one inspects the HTML\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add the title, caption and alt text, we can use the code shown below\n\np <- p  + \n  labs(title = \"**Figure 1**. Word Cloud of Commonly Discarded Items in *Alone*\",\n       caption = \"Note: Data courtesy of Daniel Oehm\",\n       alt = paste(\"A word cloud of mostly commonly discarded items on Alone\")) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(plot.title = element_markdown()) +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))\n\nThe above code gets us the following graphic. Quite honestly I think this looks good\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed this quick data visualization. Let me know what changes you might make in the comments below\n\n\nFootnotes\n\nYou can find out more about #TidyTuesday by going here.↩︎\nThe alone package was created by Daniel Oehm.
