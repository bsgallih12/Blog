# Personal Summary											
I am a third year experimental psychology doctoral candidate at Ohio University. I bring over 5 years of detail oriented experience using various quantitative research methodologies (e.g., experimental design and survey development) and conducting various statistical analyses (e.g., ANOVA, regression, moderation and mediation, meta-analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, etc.) to understand human behavior. Further I also have some experience with semi-structured interviewing. I am proficient in the use of both SPSS and R for data analysis and ggplot2 for data visualization.

## Selected Projects											
<br>
**Black Lives Matter**
<br>
•	This research looked to investigate the role that multicultural attitudes (i.e., celebration of differences) and colorblind attitudes (i.e., avoiding differences) play in predicting support for Black Lives Matter (and All Lives Matter) using a series of multiple regressions and experimental manipulations. The results largely indicate that support for Black Lives Matter is positive associated with endorsement of multicultural attitudes and negatively associated with endorsement of colorblind attitudes. By comparison, All Lives Matter support is positively associated with endorsement of colorblind attitudes and negatively associated with endorsement of multicultural attitudes. This work suggests that organizations who wish to increase support for Black Lives Matter would be wise to focus on interventions which increase one’s positive attitudes toward a multicultural society.
<br>
•	This research has resulted in one departmental talk and one research manuscript
<br>
**The Marley Hypothesis: A Gender Extension**
<br>
•	This research looked to investigate the role of historical literacy (with respect to women’s rights) on the relationship between gender and willingness to identify a situation as sexist using a series of mediation analyses. The results largely indicate that historical literacy does not impact the relationship between gender and willingness to identify a situation as sexist.
<br>
•	This research has resulted in a proposed conference poster presentation. The poster can be found here
<br>
**Christian Privilege Awareness** <br>
<br>
•	This research looked to create a scale measure to assess the level of Christian privilege awareness among self-professed Christians through the use of scale development principles (i.e., theory development) and statistical analysis (e.g., exploratory factor analysis). The results largely indicate a good measure of Christian privilege awareness with a high degree of internal reliability.
<br>
•	This research was my master’s thesis final project and resulted in a conference poster presentation
