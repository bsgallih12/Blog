Hi! My name is Brier Gallihugh and I am currently a social psychology doctoral student who studies prejudice and discrimination directed toward various religious, political and racial/ethnic groups. I am a huge *R* enthusiast. Upon completion of my Ph.D. I hope to go into either UXR or DS/DA. It is my hope that this blog will serve as a reference guide for doing statistical analyses and visualization in R and RStudio while also serving as a personal website.
