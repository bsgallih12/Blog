## What Is R?

- *R* is a statistical software package at its core
- Main purpose is for use doing statistical analysis
- However, package extensions allow it to be incorporated into various workflows
  - E.g., Creating Exams, Visualizations, Data Analysis, Tweeting, Presentation Creation

## What Is RStudio?

- RStudio is what is known as an IDE (i.e., integrative development environment) that is compatible with *R* and other languages (e.g., Python, Julia, C++, etc) developed by Posit (formerly RStudio)
- The most popular interface for using R for data analysis, package development, etc.
- Particularly nice for data analysis and statistics

## Installing R on Your Computer 

- You can find R on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org)
- You'll want to download this first prior to downloadinng RStudio

## Installing RStudio on Your Computer 

- You can find RStudio [here](https://posit.co) at the Posit website
- You can download this after you've downloaded R

# A Brief Tutorial on Using R


## Star Wars Data Set

![Star Wars Data Set](StarWars.png)

## Code

```{r library code stats}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(psych)

# Pull Out Only M & F Sex Participants
data <- starwars %>% 
  filter(sex == "male" |
           sex == "female")

#Run t-test (ANOVA)
summary(aov(mass ~ sex, data))
```

::: {.callout-note}
You have access to the *starwars* data set when you install the `tidyverse` package.
:::

## Output

```{r code output stats}
#| output: true
#| echo: false
summary(aov(mass ~ sex, data))
```

## A Brief Tutorial on Using R with RStudio (Graphics)

### Code

```{r library code graphics}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(psych)
library(plotrix)

# Data Formatting (Sex as Categorical & Conditional Recode)
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex)) %>% 
  mutate(sex = if_else(sex == "male","Male","Female"))

graph <- data %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE),
            se = std.error(height),
            t = qt(.95/2 + .5, 76 - 1),
            ci = se * t) %>% 
  ggplot(data = .,aes(x = sex, 
                      y = mean, 
                      fill = sex)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue","pink")) + 
  labs(x = "Sex",
       y = "Mean Height",
       title = "Figure 1. Mean Star Wars Height By Sex") + 
  theme_classic() + guides(fill = "none")
```

## Output

```{r code graph output}
#| output: true
#| echo: false
graph
```

## Error Bars?

```{r code graph eb}
#| echo: true
#| output: false
graph <- graph + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(y = mean, 
                    ymax = mean + ci, 
                    ymin = mean - ci), width = .75)
```

## Output

```{r eb output}
graph
```

## Final Thoughts and Future

- *R* can have a relatively steep learning curve. It can take time, repititon and practice to get proficient at
- However, the fact that it is free, used in industry, and has a vast online community willing to help make it a better long term endeavour than sticking with other programs like SPSS, SAS, MPlus, etc
- Worth noting some may prefer Python for data analysis, RStudio will work well with Python code however, this channel will be focused on R as it applies to statistics, data analysis, and visualization
