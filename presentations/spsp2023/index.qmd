##
Past research has demonstrated that Black Americans have a greater
tendency to perceive individual and systemic racism compared to White
Americans, due in part to Black Americans' better understanding of the
history of racism within the United States (i.e., *The Marley Effect*;
Nelson et al., 2012; but see Strickhouser et al., 2019).
<br>
<br>
However, racism is not the only plight faced by many Americans; sexism also has a long history within the United States (e.g., voting rights). Similarities between women's and Black Americans' oppression could suggest a
sexism-based *Marley Effect*.

# Research Question

## ##

While the evidence for this *Marley Effect* is mixed, it does raise the question as to whether or not such an effect has analogous parallels in other minority groups
<br>
<br>
This line of research will look to examine the extent to which the *Marley Effect* generalizes to gender

# Study 1 {.center}

# Hypotheses

## ##
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Historical knowledge of sexism will mediate the relationship between gender and willingness to identify various acts as sexist
